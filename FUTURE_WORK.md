## Potential Future Work for DocuSage

1. **Fully Autonomous Analyst**: One of the ambitious features we're exploring is the ability for DocuSage to act autonomously on a provided mission statement, or even with the general statement of advancing national interests. The tool would autonomously scour open platforms, conducting web searches, and collating information to generate insightful reports about topics of interest without manual input.

2. **Enhanced Multimodal Analysis**: We aim to broaden our analysis scope by adding multimodal capabilities. This would allow users to submit not only textual documents but also derive insights from images, with future expansions considering video and audio file analyses.

3. **Custom LLM Support**: While DocuSage currently integrates with the OpenAI API and offers preliminary support for custom Large Language Models, this feature likely requires further refinement. Allowing DocuSage to run without Internet access on open source LLMs is a high priority feature.
