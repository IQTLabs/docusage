## Test Plan for DocuSage

DocuSage's primary function is to generate actionable intelligence reports. To ensure the credibility and utility of these reports, it's vital that they're produced with high accuracy. This test plan addresses DocuSage's precision in report generation, especially regarding any potential LLM hallucinations or incorrect references. We'll delineate the important areas for testing and specify the metrics that imply better performance.

The areas this plan addresses are:
1. Review of literature and prior works.
2. Verification of code and structural integrity.
3. Accuracy in reference citation.
4. System behavior when lacking adequate references.

### 1. Literature Review

Hallucinations, or confident yet erroneous outputs not rooted in training data, are a common challenge for many generative AI systems. This phenomenon is evident across varying input modalities and architectural designs. Especially in large language models (LLMs), discerning such hallucinations is subjective, making it challenging to universally identify or determine a definitive 'truth'. Regardless, crafting rigorous, quantitative metrics to pinpoint and tackle hallucinations is essential.

The challenge of mitigating hallucinations remains largely unresolved, serving as an active area for research today. A diverse spectrum of stakeholders, from startups, industry players, to academic scholars, are heavily invested in finding solutions. In this section, we will delve into some prevailing techniques adopted in the industry and propose a simplified approach suitable for integration into DocuSage.

In the paper titled "Survey of Hallucination in Natural Language Generation", Ji et al. provide a comprehensive review of the hallucination problem. As natural language generation (NLG) has witnessed significant advancements due to sequence-to-sequence deep learning technologies, its applications in tasks such as abstractive summarization and dialogue generation have grown. Despite these advancements, the propensity of such models to produce hallucinated texts poses challenges to system performance. The survey presents an organized analysis of current metrics, mitigation methods, and future directions for addressing this issue, as well as an exploration of task-specific research on hallucination across various NLG tasks.

Sun et al., in their paper "Contrastive Learning Reduces Hallucination in Conversations", delve into the problem of hallucination in pre-trained language models, especially when these models are used in conversational systems. They introduce a contrastive learning scheme named MixCL designed to explicitly improve the implicit knowledge elicitation of language models, ultimately reducing the potential for hallucinations. Through their experiments on the Wizard-of-Wikipedia benchmark, the authors reveal that MixCL significantly minimizes hallucinations in language model-based dialogue agents, while also performing competitively when compared to state-of-the-art Knowledge Base (KB) grounded methods.

"SelfCheckGPT: Zero-Resource Black-Box Hallucination Detection for Generative Large Language Models" by Manakul et al. proposes a novel method for detecting hallucinations in Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for external databases or access to the model's output probability distribution. Recognizing the challenges posed by LLMs like GPT-3 which can produce non-factual statements, the authors introduce "SelfCheckGPT", a sampling-based approach. This method is grounded on the assumption that consistent knowledge produces similar sampled responses, whereas hallucinated content tends to vary considerably across different samples. The study, conducted using GPT-3 and the WikiBio dataset, proves that SelfCheckGPT effectively detects factual versus non-factual content and ranks passages by their factuality. Compared to other methods, SelfCheckGPT demonstrates competitive, if not superior, performance metrics in hallucination detection.

[YurtsAI](https://www.yurts.ai), a generative AI startup, has pioneered metrics to categorize two main hallucination error types: 
- **Type 1 (T1)**: LLM introduces novel entities.
- **Type 2 (T2)**: LLM misrepresents the connections between established entities. 

Yurts offers an open-source evaluation tool that quantitatively gauges hallucination degrees in LLM outputs. This tool, beneficial for assessing models on directive tasks, like context-aware Q&A, is available [here](https://github.com/YurtsAI/llm-hallucination-eval).

YurtAI's evaluations revealed that popular open-source LLMs, when not fine-tuned, hallucinate in roughly 55% of context-aware Q&A tasks. YurtAI has made this assessment toolkit open-source, encouraging its widespread use. They also plan to share insights on strategies and techniques to curb hallucinations.

### 2. Code and Structural Verification

**Objective**: Confirm the robustness of DocuSage's code and structure, ensuring it can consistently generate reports from provided documents.

**Test Steps**:
1. Feed a curated batch of documents into the test environment.
2. Direct DocuSage to construct a report.
3. Ascertain that DocuSage produces the report without errors.

**Expected Outcome**:
DocuSage should generate a report, sans errors.

**Unit Test**:
```bash
pytest test.py::test_initialization
```

**Metrics**:
- **Pass/Fail**: A binary metric to determine if the report generation was successful.

### 3. Accuracy in Reference Citation Tests

**Objective**: Ensure that DocuSage recognizes and cites references from supplied documents during report compilation.

**Test Steps**:
1. Feed a curated batch of documents into the test environment.
2. Command DocuSage to construct a report, focusing on specific mission from the documents.
3. Extract and compare the report's references to a known ground truth.

**Expected Outcome**:
References in the DocuSage report should align with the known references from the document batch.

**Unit Test**:
```bash
pytest test.py::test_references
```

**Benchmark**:
```bash
docusage_benchmark accuracy
```

**Metrics**:
- **True Positive Rate \(TPR\)**: Proportion of correctly identified references to the total relevant references.
- **False Positive Rate \(FPR\)**: Proportion of inaccurately identified references to the overall references noted.

### 4. Assessing Behavior in Absence of Adequate References

**Objective**: Gauge DocuSage's response when it lacks relevant documents for a specific mission.

**Test Steps**:
1. Provide documents lacking pertinent information to the requested mission.
2. Command DocuSage to generate an intelligence report.
3. Review the report, if any, that is produced.

**Expected Outcome**:
In scenarios with inadequate or unrelated references, DocuSage should either clearly highlight the lack of relevant data, abstain from making unsubstantiated statements, or throw an error.

**Unit Test**:
```bash
pytest test.py::test_irrelevant_documents_should_create_not_create_a_mission
```

**Benchmark**:
```bash
docusage_benchmark hallucination
```

**Metrics**:
- **Hallucination Rate**: Proportion of flawed reports generated compared to the total number of unsuitable inputs.
